                The logo signifies three aspects. The blue color line indicates "Line" which has two meanings , one like the lakshmana rekha in Indian Mythology which always indicates the boundary of a person and second indicates the fine line of thought process as suggested by GITA for the upliftment of the mankind. The butterfly indicates a tender change from a cocoon which indicates a layer of protection, the closed grip indicates the fallen always want the support to raise again.
